# Coaching Intelligence Platform MVP

## Project Overview
A comprehensive AI-powered coaching simulation platform designed for aspiring coaches in India to practice with realistic client personas before working with real clients.

## Key Features & MOAT
- **MOAT**: Personas persist in their personalities, talk like real people, remember their original profile and full context of discussions with coaches
- 9 diverse client personas with authentic Indian metro city backgrounds
- Text-based coaching session interface with 8-10 message exchanges
- Persona consistency mechanisms with full memory persistence 
- Professional coaching evaluation based on Tony Robbins + ICF standards
- Secure API architecture with Supabase Edge Functions
- User authentication and progress dashboard
- Complete database integration for session tracking

## Target Audience
- Aspiring coaches in India
- Focus on metro city professionals with mixed work/personal challenges

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3.4
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 API via Supabase Edge Functions
- **Backend**: Supabase (Database + Edge Functions + Authentication)
- **Memory**: localStorage + Supabase persistence
- **Security**: API key protection via Edge Functions with fallback

## Architecture Decisions
- **Memory-first approach**: Full conversation history + context management
- **Persona complexity**: Work personas with personal life spillover effects
- **Data persistence**: sessionStorage (survives page refresh only)
- **Implementation order**: Start with 3 personas, scale to 10
