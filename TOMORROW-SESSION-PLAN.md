# Tomorrow's Session Plan

## 🎯 Primary Goal: Complete MVP to 100%

### ✅ What's Ready to Go

- **Security**: All API keys secured, Netlify deployment issues resolved  
- **Personas**: Fixed role confusion - they now act as clients seeking help
- **Evaluation**: Professional reports without name-dropping
- **Core Features**: Everything working perfectly

### 🔧 Remaining Tasks (Final 5%)

#### 1. Integrate Rich Backstories (30 min)
- **Status**: Database ready, just need to connect PersonaEngine
- **What**: Fetch backstory from database and add to AI system prompt
- **Impact**: Personas will have incredible depth and authenticity
- **Risk**: Very low - simple database query + prompt enhancement

#### 2. Minor UI Polish (15 min)
- **What**: Small responsive design improvements
- **Priority**: Low - everything works, just visual polish

#### 3. Final Testing (15 min)
